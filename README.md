# Bike-sharing Program Proposal

## Overview
The Tableau visualizations below were created as a resource for investors. They use citi-bike data from New York to demonstrate why a bike-sharing program could be a successful business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results

![checkout](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\checkout.png)
Bikes are usually checked out for about 5 minutes and nearly all trips are under an hour. This potentially indicate that program is helpful for speedy, local transporation.

![checkoutgender](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\checkoutgender.png)
All the genders appear to mostly take bike trips that are about 30 minutes or less.

![tripsweekday](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\tripsweekday.png)
The stop times of bike trips reflect the availability of a person employed with a full-time job. There are peaks on weekdays around 8am and 6pm before and after when work would be. There is also a consistent busyness on the weekend from the late morning to the afternoon. 

![weekdaygender](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\weekdaygender.png)
While there are less female users, all genders generally mirror the same schedules. 

![usergender](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\usergender.png)
The unknown gender category is more often a customer while men and women are more often subscribers. Of these subscribers, Thursday has the highest popularity. 

![startinglocations](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\startinglocations.png)
The top starting locations tend to be central and west of New York.

![endinglocations](C:\Users\saman\Class\Bikeshare\endinglocations.png)
The common ending locations are incredibly similar to the starting locations. This is very covenient for strategically placing bike hubs around the city. 

## Summary

The results from Tableau show that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is certainly promising. It is much smaller than New York City and people tend to start and finish around the same locations, so it wouldn't be crucial to have many bike hubs established. Knowing the details of the average user can be influential in building the program around the people likely to participate. For example, the bike hubs can be placed near business buildings and offices of the city's prominent companies.
Two additional analyses would be beneficial:
*A map visualization similar to the starting and ending location but showing where businesses are clustered in Des Moines
*A visualization showing the popularity of the different months for the citi-bike use
